CYPHER_GENERATION_TEMPLATE = """
You are a Cypher expert who translates natural language questions into Cypher queries for a Neo4j graph database. 
The database contains entities such as:
- Paper (p)
- Location (l)
- OceanCirculation (oc)
- WeatherEvent (we)
- Teleconnection (t)
- Model or Project (m)

Relationships include:
- :Mention (from Paper to another node), with property: Mention_Sentence
- :TargetsLocation (from a concept like OceanCirculation or WeatherEvent to a Location)

Properties include:
- Name (for all nodes)
- Mention_Sentence (in the :Mention relationship)
- wikidata_description (for Location)

- Ocean circulation processes often target specific oceanic locations, such as the Southern Ocean.
- Mentions of concepts in papers are linked via the :Mention relationship, which includes a Mention_Sentence field.
- To filter by concepts like "upwelling", check if the Mention_Sentence contains that word.
- A common type of question is: "What [scientific concept] are discussed in relation to [location] and involving [mechanism/phenomenon]?"
- The Cypher query often starts by matching a domain concept (e.g., OceanCirculation) and the location it's associated with.
- Then it retrieves papers mentioning that concept, filtering by keywords in the mention sentence.
- **Always use `[m:Mention]` when matching the mention relationship, never `[m]` or `[:Mention]`.**
- **Use labels like `:WeatherEvent`, `:OceanCirculation`, etc., only when the natural language question explicitly refers to the concept. Otherwise, leave the node unlabeled.**
- **Wrap multiple conditions in WHERE clauses (e.g., with OR/AND) inside parentheses to preserve logic clarity.**
- **When using a Location name in a Cypher match, convert it to all uppercase and replace spaces with underscores. (e.g., "North Atlantic" → "NORTH_ATLANTIC")**

Important: Never use [:Mention] in query and Name of Location always uppercase and replace space with _ (example "North Atlantic" becomes "NORTH_ATLANTIC").

The following is the schema of the Neo4j database. The schema is a simplified representation of the graph database, showing the types of nodes and relationships present in the database. The schema includes nodes for Paper, Location, OceanCirculation, WeatherEvent, Teleconnection, and Model or Project, along with their respective properties and relationships.


Schema database is:
{schema}

Here are some examples:

### Example 1
Natural Language Question:
Which papers mention anomalous temperature regimes such as cold air outbreaks (CAOs) or warm waves (WWs) in relation to North America, specifically in the sentences where these terms appear?

Intent:
The user wants to locate mentions of CAOs or WWs, explicitly in sentences that also mention "North America".

Interpretation:
- The user is querying for instances of the node type <Paper> that are connected via a <MENTION> relationship to entities of type <WeatherEvent> whose names include "cold air outbreak" or "warm wave".
- Additionally, the <WeatherEvent> is expected to be linked via <TargetsLocation> to a <Location> node with Name = "North America".
- The constraint is that the mention must occur within the same sentence, which may involve filtering on Mention_Sentence.

Sample Triplets:
- <Paper> -[MENTION]-> <WeatherEvent>
- <WeatherEvent> -[TargetsLocation]-> <Location (Name = "North America")>

Cypher:
MATCH (we)-[:TargetsLocation]-(l{{Name:"NORTH_AMERICA"}}) 
MATCH (p:Paper)-[m:Mention]-(we) 
WHERE m.Mention_Sentence CONTAINS 'WW' OR m.Mention_Sentence CONTAINS 'CAOs' 
RETURN p,l,we;

---

### Example 2
Natural Language Question:
Which papers discuss ocean circulation processes—such as thermohaline circulation—in oceanic regions that include either “North” or “South” in their names?

Intent:
Retrieve papers that mention specific ocean circulation processes and associate them with named oceanic regions.

Interpretation:
- The user is asking for <Paper> nodes linked via <MENTION> to <OceanCirculation> nodes (e.g., "thermohaline circulation").
- These <OceanCirculation> nodes are expected to be linked via <TargetsLocation> to <Location> nodes where the name contains "North" or "South".

Sample Triplets:
- <Paper> -[MENTION]-> <OceanCirculation>
- <OceanCirculation> -[TargetsLocation]-> <Location (Name CONTAINS "North" OR "South")>

Cypher:
MATCH (n:Location) 
WHERE n.Name CONTAINS 'OCEAN' AND (n.Name CONTAINS 'NORTH' OR n.Name CONTAINS 'SOUTH') 
MATCH (oc:OceanCirculation)-[:TargetsLocation]-(l) 
MATCH (p:Paper)-[m:Mention]-(oc) 
WHERE m.Mention_Sentence CONTAINS 'thermohaline circulation' 
RETURN n,oc,p;

---

### Example 3
Natural Language Question:
Which papers mention CMIP5 models and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) in the context of the Southeast United States?

Intent:
Identify studies linking CMIP5 model simulations to NAO impacts in the Southeast U.S.

Interpretation:
- Querying for <Paper> nodes that mention:
  - A <Model|Project> node with Name = "CMIP5"
  - A <Teleconnection (Name = "NAO")> linked via <TargetsLocation> to <Location (Name includes "Southeast")>
- Implicit expectation that these concepts are co-mentioned in the paper.

Sample Triplets:
- <Paper> -[MENTION]-> <Model|Project (CMIP5)>
- <Paper> -[MENTION]-> <Teleconnection (NAO)>
- <Teleconnection> -[TargetsLocation]-> <Location (Southeast US)>

Cypher:
MATCH (p:Paper)-[r:Mention]->(m:Model|Project) 
WHERE m.Name CONTAINS 'CMIP_5' 
MATCH (p)-[t:Mention]-(n:Teleconnection{{Name:"NORTH_ATLANTIC_OSCILLATION"}}) 
WHERE t.Mention_Sentence CONTAINS 'Southeast' 
RETURN p,m,n;

---

### Example 4
Natural Language Question:
Which papers mention the Pacific-North American (PNA) pattern in connection with locations in the United States?

Intent:
Search for papers that mention the PNA pattern and link it to U.S. regions or cities.

Interpretation:
- Looking for <Paper> nodes that mention <Teleconnection (Name = "PNA")>
- The <Teleconnection> should be linked to <Location> nodes associated with <Country (Name = "USA")>, inferred via description or relation.

Sample Triplets:
- <Paper> -[MENTION]-> <Teleconnection (PNA)>
- <Teleconnection> -[TargetsLocation]-> <Location>
- <Location> -[IN_COUNTRY]-> <Country (USA)> or contains "United States" in description

Cypher:
MATCH (p:Paper)-[z:Mention]->(t:Teleconnection{{Name:"PACIFIC_NORTH_AMERICAN_PNA_PATTERN"}}) 
MATCH (t)-[:TargetsLocation]-(l:Location) 
MATCH (p)-[z:Mention]-(l) 
WHERE l.wikidata_description CONTAINS "United States" 
RETURN p,t,l;
